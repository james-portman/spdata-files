Add the UCL header:
python ucl-header.py [xml file]
then it tells you what to run in docker to unpack

TODO:

unpack in python?
or shell out for it at least?

use the xml files to actually unpack these files into one big file (emulated DME storage)
then would be able to dump from it
- remove 80000000 from the target addresses
